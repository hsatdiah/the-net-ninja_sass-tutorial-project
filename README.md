# The Net Ninja SASS

Here are my working files while I watched and followed https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iEwigam3gTjU_7IA3W2WZA
## Couple remarks
1. I used SASS instead SCSS;
2. I used webpack to bundle this whole stuff w/o Ruby.

## To setup you need to have node.js and webpack installed on your computer.
1. Clone repo;
2. Use command line in the project's folder;
3. Run "npm i" without quotes to install dependencies;
4. Run "webpack" or "webpack -p" at least once to build "build.js";
5. Run index.html.
